# Enumeration of Fragment Space
Here we want to generate all the molecular constitutions that are encoded in the fragment space. We ignore the issue of hidered torsion along the N-substituent bond. Therefore, we use fragments that do not have the dummy He atom that de-symmetrizes the Ph substituent. In other words, we use the fragment space defined in `../FS_noHe.params`
