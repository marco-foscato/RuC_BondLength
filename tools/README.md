# Tools
This folders collects the customized tools used in this project.

* Denoptim: de novo design software that run the evolutionary experiments. The latest version used to run the evolutionary experiments is identified by commit <a href="https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM/commit/549b53f691cf1a327bcd08148717fc22f6fcdfd1">549b53f</a> and is cloned under this folder when cloning the repository with `--recurse-submodules`. Moreover, for the sake of archiving the repo to Zenodo, it is also available as a ZIP snapshot. Note that newer releases are available at <a href="https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM">https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM</a>.

* AutoCompChem: toolbox that prepares and processes DFT jobs performed by Gaussian. The latest version used to run the evolutionary experiments is identified by commit <a href="https://github.com/denoptim-project/AutoCompChem/commit/ac27ad21a896b8d8d9eb5b887c50bc0d828f0f3e">ac27ad2</a> and is cloned under this folder when cloning the repository with `--recurse-submodules`.

Note that newer releases are available at <a href="https://github.com/denoptim-project/AutoCompChem">https://github.com/denoptim-project/AutoCompChem</a>.

* FitnessRuCH2BndLng: case-specific utility that evaluates the geometry of molecular models, compare geometrical descriptors against hard-coded thresholds, and calculated the numerical value of a candidate's fitness.
