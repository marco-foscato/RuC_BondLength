# Automated Design of NHC ligands for short Ru=C bond
This repository collects input files used to automatically design N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands (L) 
meant to generate ruthenium olefin metathesis catalysts with formula (L)Ru(Cl)(Cl)=CH<sub>2</sub>.

## Prerequisites
To reproduce the experiments the following software tools have to be installes:
* <a href="https://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/">Tinker v6.3</a> compiled with `maxval=12` in Tinker's source file `sizes.i`.
* JAVA JDK-8 can be obtained by creating and activating the conda environment as defined in the `environment.yml`.
